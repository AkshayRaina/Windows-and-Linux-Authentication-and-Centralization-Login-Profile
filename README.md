Organisation: Hewlett Packard Education Services

Abstract: Samba is a suite of programs that provide seamless file and print services for Windows clients in Linux. Unlike other implementations of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, Samba is freely available, and allows for interoperability between Linux/Unix servers and Windows/Unix/Linux clients. The project purpose was to create a domain based environment for which a Linux System was used as the server, on which Samba Server was installed and windows systems were the clients. Thus, the profiles were created on the server which could be used by windows system for login purpose and data would be stored on the server. 

Language: Linux Administration with Shell Scripting

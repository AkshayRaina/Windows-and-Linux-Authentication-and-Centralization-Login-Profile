• Samba is a suite of programs that provide seamless file and print services for Windows clients in Linux. 
• Unlike other implementations of the SMB / CIFS networking protocol, Samba is freely available and allows for interoperability between Linux/Unix servers and Windows/Unix/Linux clients. 
• The project purpose was to create a domain-based environment for which a Linux System was used as the server, on which a Samba Server was installed and Windows systems were the clients. 
• Thus, the profiles were created on the server which could be used by the Windows system for login purposes and data would be stored on the server.
